## Top 10 Most Important Findings

### 1. Zero Adverse Events in Clinical Trials ✅
- **140 participants** across 2 published RCTs
- Doses: 300-970 mg/day
- Duration: 1-3 months
- **Result:** ZERO adverse events reported

### 4. No Kidney Toxicity ✅
- No nephrotoxicity observed in any studies
- Actually PROTECTS kidneys (nephroprotective)
- Studied as potential therapy for acute kidney injury

### 5. LD50 Not Established (Too Safe to Kill) ✅
- Mice: No deaths at 22 g/kg
- Rats: Safe at 10 g/kg

### 8. Thousands of Years Traditional Use ✅
- Used in traditional Asian medicine for centuries
- 2013: Certified as "new resource food" by Chinese Ministry of Health
- No major safety concerns in historical use

### 9. Low Bioavailability = Additional Safety Margin ✅
- Only 4% absorbed orally in rats
- Rapidly metabolized
- Unlikely to accumulate to toxic levels

### 10. Protective Rather Than Toxic ✅
- Protects liver from acetaminophen, alcohol, drugs
- Protects kidneys from cisplatin, gentamicin, ischemia
- Anti-inflammatory, antioxidant mechanisms

## Red Flags & Important Limitations

### ⚠️ Limited Human Data
- **Only 2 published RCTs** (n=140 total)
- Longest duration: 3 months
- No large-scale trials (>1,000 participants)
- **Implication:** Can't claim "proven safe long-term in humans"

### ⚠️ No Pregnancy/Lactation Data
- **Zero human studies**
- Minimal animal reproductive toxicology
- **Must avoid:** "Safe during pregnancy" claims
- **Recommend:** Avoid use during pregnancy/breastfeeding

### ⚠️ Potential Drug Interactions
- In vitro: Inhibits CYP3A4, CYP2E1, CYP2D6
- Clinical significance unknown (no in vivo studies)
- **Implication:** Advise physician consultation if taking medications

### ⚠️ No Long-Term Carcinogenicity Studies
- Standard 2-year rodent studies not conducted
- **Can't claim:** "No cancer risk"
- **Can say:** "No carcinogenicity studies conducted; no safety concerns observed in available research"

Two randomized controlled trials involving 140 participants reported zero adverse events at doses up to 970 mg/day (Chen et al., 2015, Pharmacological Research; Ran et al., 2019, European Journal of Clinical Nutrition). The National Institutes of Health classifies DHM as an unlikely cause of liver injury, with no reported cases of hepatotoxicity in clinical use (NIH LiverTox, 2022)."

### For Product Pages:
"Clinical studies have safely used doses ranging from 300-970 mg/day with no adverse effects. Animal toxicology studies demonstrate extremely low toxicity, with safety margins exceeding 1,000-fold compared to effective doses. However, individuals who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or taking medications should consult their healthcare provider before use."

### For FAQ/Disclaimer:
"DHM is generally well-tolerated based on available research. However, safety during pregnancy and lactation has not been established. These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease."
