# How Long Before Drinking Should You Take DHM? (Absorption Timeline)

## Direct Answer
**Take DHM 30-45 minutes before your first drink for optimal absorption.**

## The Absorption Timeline (Visual)
[Timeline graphic showing:]
- 0 min: Take DHM
- 15 min: Initial absorption begins
- 30 min: 50% absorbed
- 45-60 min: Peak blood levels
- 2-3 hours: Half-life reached

## Why 30 Minutes Is Optimal
- Allows full stomach absorption
- Peaks right when you start drinking

## Comparison: Timing Windows

| Take DHM... | Effectiveness | Blood Level When Drinking Starts |
|-------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| 15 min before | 60-70% | Still absorbing |
| 30 min before | 90-95% | ✅ Peak levels |
| 45 min before | 85-90% | Slightly past peak |
| 1 hour before | 75-80% | Declining |
| 2 hours before | 50-60% | Need second dose |

## What Affects Absorption Speed?
- Empty stomach: Faster (20-30 min to peak)
- With food: Slower (45-60 min to peak)
- Liquid form: Fastest (15-20 min)
- Capsule: Standard (30-45 min)

## Scenario Guide
### Dinner Party (Drinking with Meal)
