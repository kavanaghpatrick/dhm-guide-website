## Recommended Pilot Strategy (Based on Issue #31)

### Phase 1: Data Collection (30-45 minutes)
Before expanding ANY posts, you need:
1. Search Console data (impressions, clicks, position) for all 9 posts
2. Traffic tier classification (HIGH: 10+ impressions, MEDIUM: 5-10, LOW: <2)
3. Competitor analysis for word count targets
4. "People Also Ask" data for FAQ validation

### Phase 2: Pilot Expansion (1.5-2 hours)
**Only expand top 2-3 posts with the highest traffic potential:**
- Recommended pilots: Posts #7-8 (hangover-related, likely highest search volume)
- Customize word count based on SERP competitors (not arbitrary 1,200 words)
- Add FAQs only if Google "People Also Ask" data supports them
- Add 3-5 peer-reviewed citations
- Add 2-3 internal links to related content
- Per-post effort: 45-60 minutes

### Phase 3: Measurement (4-6 weeks)
Monitor Search Console for pilot posts:
- Target: 25%+ click increase or 50%+ impression increase
- If successful: Scale to remaining 6 posts
- If unsuccessful: Evaluate delete/redirect strategy

## Key Insights from Issue #31 Expert Review

### What NOT to Do
- Expand all 9 posts equally (data-driven prioritization needed first)
- Use arbitrary 1,200-1,500 word targets (competitors may need 800 or 2,500)
- Add generic FAQ sections without PAA research
- Trust the "3-5 hour estimate" (realistic: 4-6+ hours minimum)

### What TO Do
- Extract Search Console data FIRST (shows which posts have ranking potential)
- Analyze top 10 SERP results for each keyword (data-driven word count)
- Pilot with highest-traffic posts only (80/20 rule)
- Measure ROI before expanding all 9 posts

---

## Critical Action Items

Before starting expansion work on ANY post:

1. **Export Search Console data:**
   - Last 90 days for all 9 posts
   - Impressions, clicks, average position
   
2. **Classify by traffic tier:**
   - Tier 1 (HIGH): 10+ impressions
   - Tier 2 (MEDIUM): 5-10 impressions  
   - Tier 3 (LOW): <2 impressions

3. **For Tier 1 posts, analyze competitors:**
   - Top 3 SERP results for target keyword
   - Word count, section structure, citations
   
4. **Set realistic word count targets:**
   - Based on competitor analysis (not 1,200 generic)
   - Range: likely 800-2,500 depending on keyword

5. **Validate FAQ sections:**
   - Pull "People Also Ask" data from Google
   - Only add FAQs that have search volume

## Next Steps

1. **Decide:** Approve simplified pilot plan or continue full expansion?
   - Pilot approach: 2 hours + 4-6 weeks measurement
   - Full expansion: 4-8 hours (all 9 posts)

2. **If approved:**
   - Pull Search Console data for all 9 posts
   - Analyze SERP competitors for top 2-3 posts
   - Allocate 1.5-2 hours for Phase 2 expansion

3. **If continuing with full expansion:**
   - Budget 4-8 hours (not 3-5)
   - Document word count analysis per keyword
   - Validate FAQ sections with PAA data
   - Plan post-expansion ROI measurement
