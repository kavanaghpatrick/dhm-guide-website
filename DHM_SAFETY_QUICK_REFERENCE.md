## Common Questions - Quick Answers

**Q: Is DHM safe?**
A: DHM has an excellent safety profile with zero adverse events reported in published clinical trials involving 140 participants. Animal studies show extremely low toxicity.

**Q: What's the maximum safe dose?**
A: Human trials have safely used up to 970 mg/day for one month. Animal studies show no toxicity at doses 1,000x higher than typical supplements.

**Q: Can DHM damage my liver?**
A: No. DHM has never been linked to liver injury and actually shows hepatoprotective (liver-protecting) effects in research.

**Q: Are there side effects?**
A: Clinical trials reported zero adverse events. Rarely, mild gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, stomach discomfort) have been reported anecdotally.

**Q: Can I take DHM with medications?**
A: Consult your physician. In vitro studies suggest potential interactions with drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2E1, and CYP2D6 enzymes.

**Q: Is DHM safe during pregnancy?**
A: No safety data exists for pregnancy. Avoid use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

**Q: How long can I take DHM?**
A: The longest published human trial was 3 months with no adverse effects. Long-term safety (>6 months) has not been formally studied.

**Q: Is DHM FDA approved?**
A: No. DHM is classified as a dietary supplement ingredient, not a drug. It does not require FDA approval for sale as a supplement.

## Drug Interaction Potential

**CYP Enzymes Inhibited (in vitro):**
- CYP3A4 (IC50: 14.75 μM) ⚠️ High concern (metabolizes 60% of drugs)
- CYP2E1 (IC50: 25.74 μM) ⚠️ Moderate concern
- CYP2D6 (IC50: 22.69 μM) ⚠️ Moderate concern

**Clinical Significance:** Unknown (in vivo studies needed)

**Recommendation:** Advise physician consultation if on medications

## Content Writing Templates

### Balanced Safety Statement
"Dihydromyricetin demonstrates an excellent safety profile in published research, with zero adverse events reported in clinical trials involving 140 participants. Animal studies show extremely low toxicity, and DHM has never been linked to liver or kidney injury. However, safety during pregnancy has not been established, and individuals taking medications should consult their physician before use."

### Conservative Safety Statement
"DHM has been studied in limited human clinical trials showing good tolerability with no reported adverse events. While animal research suggests low toxicity, more long-term human studies are needed. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should avoid use due to insufficient safety data."

### Evidence-Based Disclaimer
"These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA. DHM is a dietary supplement and is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. Consult your healthcare provider before use, especially if pregnant, nursing, or taking medications."
