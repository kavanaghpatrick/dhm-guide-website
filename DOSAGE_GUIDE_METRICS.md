## Content Performance Patterns

### What Converts (High CTR Content)
```
✅ Hyper-specific numbers (500mg, not 400-600mg)
✅ Personalization tables (find YOUR dose)
✅ Question-match titles ("How Much Should I Take?")
✅ Weight-based guidance (under 130, 130-180, over 180)
✅ Before/after clarity (BEFORE drinking, not after)
✅ Emoji visual hierarchy (🔴💊⏰)
✅ Immediate answers (first 4 lines)
```

### What Doesn't Convert (Low CTR Content)
```
❌ Generic titles ("Complete Guide to...")
❌ Vague guidance ("adjust based on needs")
❌ Background-first structure (save science for later)
❌ Single CTA at end (need 10-15 throughout)
❌ Paraphrased FAQs (match EXACT query)
❌ Long paragraphs (mobile users bounce)
❌ No personalization (everyone gets same advice)
```
