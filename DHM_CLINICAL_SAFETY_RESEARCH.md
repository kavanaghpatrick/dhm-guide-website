## Executive Summary

Dihydromyricetin (DHM) demonstrates an **excellent safety profile** with nearly no toxicity observed in both animal and human studies. The compound has been used in traditional Asian medicine for thousands of years and is characterized by:

- **Exceptionally high LD50** - No deaths at doses up to 22 g/kg in mice
- **No reported serious adverse events** in human clinical trials
- **Hepatoprotective** rather than hepatotoxic
- **Nephroprotective** rather than nephrotoxic
- **Wide safety margin** - Therapeutic doses 1-15 mg/kg vs. safe doses >10,000 mg/kg
- **Quality of Evidence:** MODERATE (limited human studies, extensive animal data)

**Key Limitation:** Very few human clinical trials published; most data from animal studies and traditional use.

## 1. Animal Toxicology Studies

### 1.1 Acute Toxicity (LD50)

| Species | Dosage | Outcome | Reference |
|---------|--------|---------|-----------|
| Mice | 22 g/kg (single dose) | No deaths, no toxic effects (14-day observation) | Multiple sources |
| Mice | 21.5 g/kg (water extract) | No symptoms of poisoning or death | A. grossedentata extract study |
| Mice | 5,000 mg/kg (single dose) | No deaths or signs of toxicity | Standard toxicity study |
| Rats | 10 g/kg (acute) | Identified as "safe dose" | Previous acute toxicity tests |
| Mice | 16 g/kg (estimated) | Maximum safe dose (BSA normalization) | Pharmacokinetic modeling |

**Conclusion:** LD50 has not been established because no lethal dose has been identified in standard toxicity testing.

**Human Equivalent Dose (HED):**
- Using 16% HED ratio: Safe upper limit = **15.68 g for a 70 kg person**
- Using BSA normalization: Estimated safe dose = **1.6 g/kg** (~112 g for 70 kg person)

### 1.2 Chronic Toxicity

| Study Type | Species | Duration | Dosage | Outcome |
|------------|---------|----------|--------|---------|
| Subacute | Rats | 30 days | Up to 1,000 mg/kg daily | No adverse effects |
| Chronic feeding | Mice | 90 days | A. grossedentata extract | No negative effects on development, hematology, biochemistry, pathology; enhanced immune function |
| Long-term | Mice | 6 weeks | 200 mg/kg | No toxic effects |
| Chronic | Rats/Mice | Long-term | Total flavone of A. grossedentata | No negative effects on development or organ function |

**Conclusion:** No chronic toxicity observed even with long-term administration at therapeutic doses.

### 1.3 Genotoxicity Studies

| Test Type | Result | Reference |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Ames test (mutagenicity) | **Negative** | Hunan Provincial CDC |
| Mouse bone marrow micronucleus test | **Negative** | Hunan Provincial CDC |
| Mouse sperm deformity test | **Negative** | Hunan Provincial CDC |

**Note:** Some controversy exists regarding flavonoid genotoxicity in general, but specific DHM testing shows negative results.
