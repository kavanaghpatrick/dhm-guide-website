# DHM (Dihydromyricetin) Regulatory Status & Quality Standards Report

**Research Date:** November 9, 2025
**Purpose:** Comprehensive analysis of DHM's legal status, regulatory classification, and quality standards globally

---

## Executive Summary

Dihydromyricetin (DHM) occupies a complex regulatory landscape. While it is sold as a dietary supplement in multiple countries, it lacks explicit GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) designation from the FDA and has no approved novel food status in the EU. The ingredient has a strong safety profile based on toxicology studies, but quality standards vary significantly by manufacturer, and third-party certification is rare. Consumers must carefully evaluate products for purity, testing, and appropriate manufacturing standards.

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ **Generally safe** based on toxicology studies (no acute or chronic toxicity)
- ⚠️ **Regulatory gray area** in US (sold as dietary supplement, but FDA warns against hangover cure claims)
- ❌ **Not approved as novel food in EU** (application pending since 2022)
- ✅ **Approved in Canada** (at least one product has NPN 80122969)
- ⚠️ **Poor bioavailability** (only 4% oral bioavailability) - formulation matters significantly
- ⚠️ **No USP monograph** - no official purity/testing standards
- 🔴 **Third-party testing rare** - few products are NSF/USP/ConsumerLab verified

---

## 7. Extraction Methods & Solvent Safety

### Common Extraction Methods

#### 1. Hot Water Extraction
- **Process:** Dried plant material extracted with hot water in batch process
- **Solvents:** Water only
- **Safety:** ✅ Safest method, no solvent residue concerns
- **Purity:** Typically lower (yields crude extract with multiple compounds)
- **Pros:** Natural, safe, traditional method
- **Cons:** Lower DHM concentration, requires further purification

#### 2. Ethanol/Alcohol Extraction
- **Process:** Plant material soaked in ethanol, then solvent evaporated
- **Solvents:** Ethanol (GRAS substance)
- **Safety:** ✅ Generally safe; ethanol is food-grade
- **Purity:** Moderate to high (depends on purification steps)
- **Pros:** Efficient extraction, relatively safe solvent
- **Cons:** Requires evaporation step; residual ethanol must be monitored

#### 3. Methanol Extraction (Soxhlet)
- **Process:** Continuous extraction using methanol in Soxhlet apparatus
- **Solvents:** Methanol (toxic if residues remain)
- **Safety:** ⚠️ Requires testing for residual methanol (ICH Class 2 solvent)
- **Purity:** Moderate
- **Pros:** Efficient for research purposes
- **Cons:** Methanol toxicity concern; must be removed completely

#### 4. Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction (UAE)
- **Process:** Ultrasonic waves create cavitation bubbles that disrupt cell walls
- **Solvents:** Water, ethanol, or combination
- **Safety:** ✅ Safe (depends on solvent used)
- **Purity:** High
- **Pros:** Faster, higher yield, better efficiency than traditional methods
- **Cons:** Requires specialized equipment

#### 5. Chromatographic Purification
- **Process:** Crude extract purified using column chromatography (e.g., high-speed counter-current chromatography)
- **Solvents:** n-hexane, ethyl acetate, methanol, water (solvent system varies)
- **Safety:** ⚠️ Must test for residual solvents
- **Purity:** Highest (>99% achievable in 9 hours)
- **Pros:** Pharmaceutical-grade purity
- **Cons:** Expensive, used for research-grade DHM

#### 6. Chelation Extraction (Novel Method)
- **Process:** Zn²⁺ introduced to chelate with DHM
- **Solvents:** Varies
- **Safety:** ⚠️ Requires verification that zinc is removed
- **Purity:** ~94.3%
- **Pros:** Innovative approach, high purity
- **Cons:** Novel method, not widely adopted

---

### Solvent Residue Safety

**Key Principle:** Extraction solvent must be removed to safe levels before human consumption.

**Safe Solvents (minimal concern if trace amounts remain):**
- Water
- Ethanol (GRAS)
- Acetic acid (food-grade)

**Solvents Requiring Testing:**
- Methanol (ICH Class 2 - limit: ≤300 ppm)
- Acetone (ICH Class 3 - limit: ≤500 ppm)
- Ethyl acetate (ICH Class 3 - limit: ≤500 ppm)
- n-Hexane (ICH Class 2 - limit: ≤29 ppm)

**Red Flag Solvents (should be avoided):**
- Benzene (ICH Class 1 - carcinogenic)
- Carbon tetrachloride (ICH Class 1 - toxic)

**Verification:**
- Reputable manufacturers should provide **Certificate of Analysis (CoA)** showing residual solvent testing results
- Testing method: **Gas Chromatography (GC)**

---

## 8. Bioavailability & Formulation Quality

### The Bioavailability Problem

**Critical Issue:** DHM has **extremely poor oral bioavailability**

**Key Data:**
- **Oral bioavailability in rats: Only 4.02%**
- **Water solubility: Only 0.2 mg/mL at 25°C**
- **Classification:** BCS Class IV drug (low solubility + low membrane permeability)

**What This Means for Consumers:**
- Taking 300 mg DHM capsule = only ~12 mg absorbed into bloodstream
- Most DHM passes through digestive system without absorption
- **Formulation matters enormously** - poorly formulated products may have negligible effects

---

### Stability Issues

**Chemical Instability:**
- Phenol hydroxyl groups make DHM chemically unstable
- **Oxidation** is main cause of degradation
- **pH-dependent stability:**
  - ✅ Stable in stomach (acidic environment)
  - ❌ Unstable in duodenum, small intestine, colon (alkaline pH)

**Storage Concerns:**
- DHM degrades over time if not properly formulated/packaged
- Exposure to light, heat, moisture accelerates degradation

---

### Advanced Formulations to Improve Bioavailability

**Why This Matters:** Standard DHM powder/capsules have 4% bioavailability. Advanced formulations can improve this **5-10× or more**.

#### 1. Cocrystals with Crystallization Inhibitors
- **Bioavailability improvement:** ~5-fold enhancement
- **Method:** DHM cocrystallized with polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 (PVP)
- **Mechanism:** Inhibits precipitation in GI tract, keeping DHM in solution longer
- **Salt-cocrystal with ciprofloxacin:** 8-fold bioavailability enhancement

#### 2. Nanoparticle Systems
- **Technology:** DHM embedded in zein-caseinate nanoparticles
- **Bioavailability improvement:** Significant increase in rats
- **Mechanism:** Improved adhesion and retention time in GI tract; enhanced absorption

#### 3. Microemulsions
- **Drug release:** 72.34% (vs. 36.28% for plain suspension)
- **Limitation:** Not as effective due to DHM's low membrane permeability
- **Note:** Improved solubility ≠ improved absorption for BCS Class IV drugs

#### 4. Gastric Floating Pills
- **Strategy:** Retain DHM in acidic stomach environment where it's stable
- **Mechanism:** Selective and sustained absorption in stomach
- **Pros:** Avoids alkaline intestine where DHM degrades
- **Technology:** Floating drug carriers stay in stomach longer

#### 5. Other Technologies (Research Stage)
- **Solid dispersions**
- **Nanocapsules**
- **Cyclodextrin inclusion complexes**
- **Phospholipid complexes**
- **Chemical/enzymatic acylation**

---

### How to Identify Quality Formulations

**Red Flags (Likely Poor Bioavailability):**
- Plain DHM powder in capsule with no excipients
- No mention of enhanced absorption/bioavailability
- Only lists "DHM 98% purity" with no formulation details
- Extremely cheap products (suggests no investment in formulation)

**Good Signs (Better Bioavailability):**
- Mentions "enhanced bioavailability" or "liposomal" or "nanoparticle"
- Contains absorption enhancers (e.g., piperine, PVP, lecithin)
- Formulated with fats/oils (improves solubility)
- Enteric coating (protects from alkaline pH degradation)
- Product backed by pharmacokinetic studies

**Gold Standard:**
- Clinical studies showing blood levels of DHM after dosing
- Pharmacokinetic data (Cmax, AUC, Tmax)
- Comparative bioavailability testing vs. plain DHM

---

## 11. Recommendations for Consumers

### Finding High-Quality, Safe DHM Supplements

**Priority 1: Third-Party Tested Products**
- Look for NSF Certified, USP Verified, or ConsumerLab Approved products
- If none available, choose brands that provide accessible, batch-specific CoAs

**Priority 2: Verify Purity & Potency**
- Select products with ≥98% DHM purity
- Ensure specific DHM content per serving is listed (not hidden in proprietary blend)
- Verify via CoA that purity claim is tested and accurate

**Priority 3: Manufacturing Quality**
- Choose products from cGMP-certified facilities
- Ideally NSF GMP certified or third-party audited
- Verify facility is FDA-registered (not "FDA-approved")

**Priority 4: Safety Testing**
- Confirm product is tested for heavy metals (lead, arsenic, cadmium, mercury)
- Verify pesticide screening (especially for botanical source)
- Check microbiological testing results (bacteria, yeast, mold)

**Priority 5: Formulation for Bioavailability**
- Consider advanced formulations (nanoparticles, liposomal, cocrystals) if available
- Plain DHM powder has only 4% bioavailability - may be ineffective
- Look for products mentioning bioavailability enhancement

**Priority 6: Transparency & Ethics**
- Choose companies with transparent sourcing and testing practices
- Avoid companies making illegal drug claims or unrealistic promises
- Support brands that invest in clinical research and publish data

### Specific Product Recommendations (Based on Research)

**Note:** This report does not endorse specific brands, but provides criteria to evaluate products.

**Look for products that:**
1. Are third-party tested (NSF, USP, or ConsumerLab)
2. Provide batch-specific CoA with heavy metals testing
3. Specify ≥98% DHM purity
4. Are manufactured in cGMP-certified facilities
5. State clear DHM content per serving (e.g., 300-500 mg)
6. Source from Hovenia dulcis or Ampelopsis grossedentata
7. Ideally use bioavailability-enhancing formulation
8. Make conservative, evidence-based claims
9. Have responsive customer service
10. Have established reputation (>2 years in business)

**If no DHM products meet all criteria:**
- Prioritize third-party testing and transparency over other factors
- Request CoA before purchasing
- Start with smaller quantity to assess quality before bulk buying

### Regulatory & Safety Summary for Consumers

**✅ DHM is generally safe based on:**
- Extensive animal toxicology studies showing no acute or chronic toxicity
- Human clinical trial (80 patients, 1 month) showing no adverse reactions
- Traditional use for 2,000+ years in China
- No reported cases of liver injury (LiverTox database)

**⚠️ Regulatory status is mixed:**
- US: Allowed as dietary supplement, but cannot make hangover cure claims
- Canada: Approved (at least one product has NPN)
- EU: Not approved as novel food (application pending, quality concerns raised)
- Australia: Not registered as therapeutic good
- China: Vine tea approved as food ingredient (2013)
- South Korea: Approved for alcoholism treatment (2008)

**❌ Quality control is a major concern:**
- No USP monograph or official quality standards
- Third-party certification is rare
- EFSA found 10-fold variation in batch quality
- Many products lack independent testing
- Bioavailability is poor (4%) without advanced formulation

**🎯 Consumer Action Steps:**
1. **Verify third-party testing** - Don't trust manufacturer's claims alone
2. **Request Certificate of Analysis** - Reputable companies will provide it
3. **Check for GMP certification** - Ensures basic manufacturing quality
4. **Evaluate bioavailability** - Plain DHM powder likely ineffective
5. **Avoid illegal claims** - Companies making drug claims are unethical
6. **Start low, go slow** - Assess tolerance and effectiveness
7. **Report adverse events** - Use FDA MedWatch if problems occur

- Demand third-party testing and Certificates of Analysis
- Verify GMP manufacturing standards
- Choose products with specified purity (≥98%) and potency
- Consider bioavailability-enhanced formulations
- Avoid products making illegal drug claims
- Start with reputable companies that invest in transparency and testing

**The DHM market is evolving.** As clinical research expands and regulatory frameworks develop, quality standards will likely improve. Until then, consumers must be informed advocates for their own safety and effectiveness by carefully evaluating products against the criteria outlined in this report.
