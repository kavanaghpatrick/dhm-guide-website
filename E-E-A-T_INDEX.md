## ESTIMATED TIME & BUDGET

### Time Investment:

| Phase | Time | When |
|-------|------|------|
| Phase 1: E-E-A-T Foundation | 4 hours | Week 1 |
| Phase 2: Hire Medical Reviewer | 5 hours | Months 2-3 |
| Phase 3: Publish Pages | 4 hours | Months 2-3 |
| **Total** | **13 hours** | **2-3 months** |

### Budget:

| Item | Cost | Frequency |
|------|------|-----------|
| Medical reviewer setup | $200-500 | One-time |
| Author photo | $0-200 | One-time |
| Medical review per guide | $50-100 | Per guide |
| **One-Time Total** | **$200-700** | - |
| **Ongoing Monthly** | **$100-200** | 2 guides/month |

**Annual Cost:** $1,200-2,400 (ongoing reviews)

**ROI:** Protection from algorithm penalties (one health update could wipe 100% of traffic)

---

## PRIORITIZATION

### DO THIS FIRST (Week 1):

1. Write author bio (30 minutes)
2. Add medical disclaimer to footer (45 minutes)
3. Post Upwork job for PharmD (45 minutes)
4. Draft About Us page (1 hour)

**Why:** These are quick wins that establish baseline E-E-A-T signals immediately.

### DO THIS NEXT (Months 2-3):

1. Hire PharmD reviewer (2 hours to vet + setup)
2. Submit 3-5 articles for review (1-2 weeks reviewer time)
3. Add medical review badges (30 minutes)
4. Publish About/Author pages (2 hours)

**Why:** Medical review is the highest-impact E-E-A-T signal for health content.

### DO THIS LAST (Ongoing):

1. Review new content monthly ($50-100 per guide)
2. Update "Last reviewed" dates annually
3. Verify reviewer credentials annually

**Why:** Maintenance keeps E-E-A-T signals current and protects against penalties.

## KEY DECISIONS

### Decision #1: PharmD vs RD vs MD?
**Answer:** PharmD (Doctor of Pharmacy)
- Best for supplement content (dosage, safety, interactions)
- Cost-effective ($200-500 setup, $50-100 per review)
- Relevant credentials for DHM content

**See:** E-E-A-T_AUDIT_AUGMENTATIONS.md, Issue #60, Augmentation #2

### Decision #2: What citation style?
**Answer:** AMA (American Medical Association)
- Numbered superscripts (cleanest visual)
- Industry standard (Healthline, WebMD)
- Easy to implement

**See:** E-E-A-T_QUICK_REFERENCE.md, "Q: What citation style?"

### Decision #3: Show license number publicly?
**Answer:** NO
- Privacy concern
- Not standard on health websites
- Show name + credentials + specialization instead

**See:** E-E-A-T_AUDIT_AUGMENTATIONS.md, Issue #67, Augmentation #4

### Decision #4: How many articles to review initially?
**Answer:** 3-5 cornerstone articles
- Highest traffic (dosage guide, comparison posts)
- Most health claims (safety, interactions)
- Longest content (5,000+ words)

**See:** E-E-A-T_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md, Phase 2, Week 4-5
