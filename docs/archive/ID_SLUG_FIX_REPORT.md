## Date: 2025-07-30

### Summary
Successfully fixed 24 files where the ID field didn't match the slug field. This ensures consistent routing and improves SEO for the affiliate revenue site.

### Changes Made

#### ID Updates (24 files)
All files had their `id` field updated to match their `slug` field for consistency.

#### File Renames (8 files)
The following files were renamed to match their slug names:

1. `complete-guide-asian-flush-comprehensive-original.json` → `complete-guide-asian-flush-comprehensive.json`
2. `dda614c2-8533-4758-8005-342aa86396a9.json` → `alcohol-work-performance-professional-impact-guide-2025.json`
3. `flyby-vs-fuller-health-complete-comparison-2025.json` → `flyby-vs-fuller-health-complete-comparison.json`
4. `dhm-asian-flush-science-backed-solution-original.json` → `dhm-asian-flush-science-backed-solution.json`
5. `asian-flush-vs-alcohol-allergy-comparison-original.json` → `asian-flush-vs-alcohol-allergy-comparison.json`
6. `dhm-supplement-stack-guide-complete-combinations-enhanced.json` → `dhm-supplement-stack-guide-complete-combinations.json`

8. `dhm-supplement-stack-guide-complete-combinations-backup.json` → `dhm-supplement-stack-guide-complete-combinations.json`

### Special Cases Fixed

1. **UUID-based IDs**: Files like `social-media's-unseen-influence-navigating-alcohol-wellness-in-the-digital-age.json` had UUID IDs that were replaced with the slug
2. **Numeric IDs**: Files with simple numeric IDs (1, 5, 1001, etc.) were updated to use their slug
3. **Shortened IDs**: Files where the ID was a shortened version of the slug were expanded to match exactly

### Backup Location
All original files were backed up to: `backups/id_slug_fix_20250730_054347`

### Impact
- ✅ Consistent routing - URLs will now properly match the JSON filenames and slugs
- ✅ Improved SEO - Search engines won't encounter conflicting identifiers

- ✅ No more UUID confusion - Eliminated the mysterious `dda614c2-8533-4758-8005-342aa86396a9.json` file

### Verification
The script verified that all mismatches have been resolved. The site should now have consistent ID/slug pairs across all blog post JSON files.
