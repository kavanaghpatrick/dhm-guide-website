# Responsive Images Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented a responsive image component and optimized the homepage images to serve appropriately sized versions based on viewport width. This will significantly improve page load performance by reducing unnecessary data transfer.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created ResponsiveImage Component
- **Location**: `/src/components/ResponsiveImage.jsx`
- **Features**:
  - Automatic srcset generation for responsive loading
  - Blur-up placeholder support for better perceived performance
  - Lazy loading with native browser API
  - Flexible sizing configuration

### 2. Generated Multiple Image Sizes
- **Script**: `/scripts/optimize-infographics.js`
- **Sizes Generated**:
  - 380w (for mobile devices)
  - 760w (for tablets/small laptops)
  - 1536w (original size for large displays)

### 3. Optimized Images
- `/src/assets/02_liver_protection_infographic-*.webp`
- `/src/assets/04_gaba_receptor_mechanism-*.webp`
- Hero image at `/public/images/before-after-dhm-*.webp` (already optimized)

### 4. Updated Homepage Implementation
- Modified `Home.jsx` to use the ResponsiveImage component
- Imported all image sizes explicitly for Vite bundling
- Added placeholder data for instant visual feedback

## Performance Benefits

### Before
- Images served at 1536x1024 regardless of display size
- Mobile users downloading ~68KB per infographic when only needing ~13KB

### After
- Mobile devices (≤640px): Download 380w version (~13KB)
- Tablets/small laptops (≤1024px): Download 760w version (~32KB)
- Large displays: Download 1536w version (~68KB)
- **Potential savings**: Up to 80% reduction in image bytes for mobile users

## How to Add More Responsive Images

1. **Add images to optimize list** in `/scripts/optimize-infographics.js`
2. **Run optimization**: `node scripts/optimize-infographics.js`
3. **Import in component**:
   ```jsx
   import image380w from '../assets/image-380w.webp'
   import image760w from '../assets/image-760w.webp'
   import image1536w from '../assets/image-1536w.webp'
   import placeholderData from '../assets/image-placeholder.json'
   
   const srcSet = {
     '380w': image380w,
     '760w': image760w,
     '1536w': image1536w
   }
   ```
4. **Use ResponsiveImage component**:
   ```jsx
   <ResponsiveImage
     src={image1536w}
     srcSet={srcSet}
     alt="Descriptive alt text"
     sizes={[380, 760, 1536]}
     sizesAttr="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, (max-width: 1024px) 50vw, 760px"
     width={1536}
     height={1024}
     placeholder={placeholderData.image.base64}
   />
   ```

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers: Full srcset and WebP support
- Older browsers: Fallback to largest image size
- Placeholder blur-up: Progressive enhancement (degrades gracefully)

## Next Steps for Further Optimization

1. Consider generating AVIF versions for modern browsers (even smaller file sizes)
2. Implement critical image preloading for above-the-fold images
3. Add width/height attributes to prevent layout shift
4. Monitor Core Web Vitals to measure improvement
