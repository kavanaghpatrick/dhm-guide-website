- Best Budget DHM
- Best Premium DHM

**Opportunities:**
- "Best DHM for Wine Drinkers"
- "Best DHM for Beer Hangovers"
- "Best DHM for Spirits"
- "Best DHM for Business Travelers"
- "Best DHM for Weekend Warriors"

### Linking Opportunities in Existing Non-Review Content

#### General DHM Content Should Link To:
1. dhm-supplements-comparison-center-2025
2. Top 3 recommended products based on context
3. Relevant "VS" comparison posts

**Examples:**
- dhm-dosage-guide-2025 → link to products at different potencies
