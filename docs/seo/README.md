## Measurement Framework

### Baseline Metrics (Capture Now)
Use Google Analytics 4 to track:
1. Pages per session (overall + by landing cluster)
2. Average session duration
3. Bounce rate by cluster topic
4. Internal link click events
5. Product page views from internal referrals
6. Conversion rate by traffic source

### Weekly Check-ins (During Implementation)
- Internal links added (running count toward 2,000+)
- Hub posts created/updated (18 total)
- Cluster posts updated (173 total)
- Quality spot-checks (20% sample)

### Monthly Reviews (Post-Implementation)
- Cluster-specific KPIs:
  - Hub post traffic rank (should be top 10%)
  - Cluster depth rate (% viewing 3+ posts)
  - Within-cluster bounce rate
  - Average time on cluster

### Quarterly Strategic Review
- Compare pre/post metrics
- Identify top-performing clusters
- Adjust cross-cluster linking strategy
- Plan new content to fill gaps

## Key Insights from Analysis

### Discovery 1: Overlapping Topics Create Natural Bridges
Many posts fit multiple clusters (e.g., "DHM Dosage Guide" belongs to both Safety AND Usage). This creates natural linking opportunities.

**Action:** Use overlap posts as bridges between clusters.

### Discovery 2: Hub Posts Create Force Multipliers
A single well-linked hub post can drive traffic to 20-40 related posts, creating exponential engagement.

**Action:** Prioritize hub post creation and promotion.

### Discovery 3: User Journey Varies by Cluster
- Commercial clusters: Safety → Product → Purchase
- Educational clusters: Problem → Impact → Solution
- Lifestyle clusters: Demographics → Scenarios → Integration

**Action:** Tailor internal linking to match cluster-specific journeys.

### Discovery 4: Long-Tail Dominates Traffic
Niche clusters (Asian Flush, Cultural Guides) have fewer posts but highly targeted audiences with strong commercial intent.

**Action:** Don't neglect small clusters—they punch above their weight.

## Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to implement all 18 clusters at once?
**A:** No. Start with Phases 1-2 (hub creation) for all clusters, then implement Phase 3 (internal linking) in priority order: Safety → Hangover → Products → Usage → Liver Health.

### Q: What if a post fits multiple clusters?
**A:** That's ideal! Use it as a "bridge post" linking between clusters. Include links to both cluster hubs.

### Q: How many internal links per post?
**A:**
- Tier 1 (Commercial core): 10-15 links
- Tier 2 (High-value support): 6-10 links
- Tier 3 (Lifestyle/niche): 4-8 links

### Q: Should hub posts link to ALL cluster posts?
**A:** Yes, but organize them (by topic, symptom, use case) so users can find relevant content. Don't just list 40+ links randomly.

### Q: How do I measure success?
**A:** Primary metric is **pages per session** (+25% target). Secondary: internal link CTR, cluster depth rate, organic traffic growth.

## Technical Notes

### Posts Analyzed
- **Source directory:** `/src/newblog/data/posts/`
- **Published posts:** 169 JSON files
- **Archived posts:** 4 JSON files
- **Total analyzed:** 173 posts

### Analysis Method
- Python script analyzed title, slug, excerpt, and content patterns
- Posts grouped by semantic similarity and user intent
- Manual review and refinement of cluster assignments
- Cross-cluster relationships mapped based on user journeys

### Cluster Assignment Rules
Posts were assigned to clusters based on keyword patterns in:
1. Post title
2. Post slug
3. Post excerpt
4. Inferred user intent (safety, symptom relief, product research, etc.)

Some posts appear in multiple clusters when they serve multiple user needs (e.g., dosage guide serves both safety and usage clusters).
