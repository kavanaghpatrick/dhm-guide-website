### Link Equity Distribution Strategy

1. **Homepage** → Tier 1 Hubs (4 links)
2. **Main Navigation** → Tier 1 Hubs (4 links) + Tier 2 Hubs (8 links)
3. **Footer** → All Hubs (12 links)
4. **Tier 1 Hubs** → Tier 2 Hubs (2-3 each) + Tier 3 Posts (15-50 each)
5. **Tier 2 Hubs** → Tier 1 Hubs (1-2 each) + Tier 3 Posts (8-40 each)
6. **Tier 3 Posts** → Tier 1 Hub (1) + Tier 2 Hub (1) + Tier 3 Posts (5-8)
7. **Blog Listing** → All Hubs (12 filters) + All Posts (169)

**Link Budget per Page Type:**

| Page Type | Internal Links Out | Priority |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| Homepage | 25-30 | Tier 1 (60%), Tier 2 (30%), Posts (10%) |
| Tier 1 Hub | 30-60 | Tier 2 (20%), Posts (70%), Other Tier 1 (10%) |

## SEO & Technical Considerations

### Schema Markup for Hub Pages

**Add BreadcrumbList schema:**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
  "itemListElement": [{
    "@type": "ListItem",
    "position": 1,
    "name": "Home",
    "item": "https://dhmguide.com/"
  },{
    "@type": "ListItem",
    "position": 2,
    "name": "Hangover Science",
    "item": "https://dhmguide.com/hangover-guide"
  }]
}
```

**Add CollectionPage schema for hubs:**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "CollectionPage",
  "name": "Complete Hangover Science & Prevention Guide",
  "description": "Comprehensive resource...",
  "about": {
    "@type": "Thing",
    "name": "Hangover Prevention"
  },
  "hasPart": [
    {
      "@type": "Article",
      "headline": "How to Get Rid of Hangover Fast",
      "url": "https://dhmguide.com/never-hungover/how-to-get-rid-of-hangover-fast"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Internal Linking Best Practices

1. **Anchor Text Variation**
   - Use natural, contextual anchor text
   - Avoid over-optimization
   - Mix exact match, partial match, and branded anchors

2. **Link Depth**
   - Keep all posts within 3 clicks from homepage
   - Homepage → Hub (1 click) → Post (2 clicks)
   - Homepage → Main Nav → Hub → Post (3 clicks)

3. **Link Equity Flow**
   - Homepage links to Tier 1 hubs (4 links)
   - Tier 1 hubs link to Tier 2 hubs (2-3 each)
   - All hubs link to relevant posts (15-50 each)
   - Posts link back up to hubs (2-3 each)

4. **Orphan Page Prevention**
   - Every post must have at least 3 internal links TO it
   - Every post must have at least 8 internal links FROM it
   - Use sidebar widgets to ensure minimum link count
