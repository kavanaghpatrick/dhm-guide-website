## The Problem at a Glance

```
Google Search Console Finding:
"Duplicate without user-selected canonical" on 12 blog posts

Google chose:    https://www.dhmguide.com/never-hungover/post-slug/
Your site said:  https://www.dhmguide.com/never-hungover/post-slug

Root Cause: 4 URL variants serving identical content
  1. /never-hungover/post-slug       (your canonical)
  2. /never-hungover/post-slug/      (trailing slash - DUPLICATE)
  3. /blog/post-slug                 (legacy - redirects but sends duplicate signal)
  4. /newblog/post-slug              (legacy - redirects but sends duplicate signal)
```

---

## Solution Summary

### The Fix (2 Hours)

1. **vercel.json**: Add trailing slash redirect (15 min)
2. **App.jsx**: Remove client-side /newblog redirect (10 min)
3. **canonical-fix.js**: Normalize path for canonicals (5 min)
4. **Deploy & Verify**: Test changes (10 min)
5. **GSC**: Request reindexing (5 min)

### Expected Outcome

- Week 1: Google recrawls with single canonical
- Week 2-4: Duplicate entries consolidated
- Ongoing: New posts auto-canonicalized correctly

## Questions & Troubleshooting

**Q: Why does Google choose a different canonical?**
A: When multiple URL variants serve identical content with conflicting canonical signals, Google picks one based on crawl order, recency, and established authority.

**Q: Will this affect current rankings?**
A: No. Consolidating duplicates to single canonical typically improves rankings by concentrating SEO signals.

**Q: How long until Google consolidates?**
A: 1-4 weeks depending on crawl frequency and your site authority.

**Q: Should we update old backlinks?**
A: No. 301 redirects will pass signal. Let Google naturally consolidate.

**Q: What about new blog posts?**
A: Follow prevention checklist (page end of DUPLICATE_CONTENT_FINDINGS.md) to prevent future issues.
