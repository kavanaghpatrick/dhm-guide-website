## Will These Help with the August 13 Drop?

| Fix | Aug 13 Drop? | Recovery Help? |
|-----|-------------|----------------|
| Phase 1 Canonicals | NO | MEDIUM (reduces confusion) |
| Phase 2 Prerendering | MAYBE | LOW (unlikely main cause) |
| Phase 3 Comparisons | NO | MEDIUM (improves quality) |
| Meta Descriptions | POSSIBLY | HIGH (indexing signal) |

**Most likely to help**: Meta descriptions (50-70% recovery expected)  
**Least likely to help**: Static prerendering (good practice but not root cause)

## What's NOT Fixed (Still Needs Work)

### üî¥ Aug 13 De-indexing Event Root Cause
- **Status**: Unknown and unaddressed
- **Possible causes**:
  - Core algorithm update
  - Manual action
  - Content quality issues
  - Medical/YMYL compliance problems
  - Technical issues unrelated to redirects

### üü° E-E-A-T Signals (Expertise, Experience, Authority, Trustworthiness)
- **Status**: Not evaluated or enhanced
- **Risk**: High for YMYL (health/supplement) content
- **Missing**: Author credentials, medical review signals, citations

### üü° Core Web Vitals Performance
- **Status**: Partially addressed (Phase 2 may help)
- **Known issue**: 74/100 mobile performance score
- **Missing**: Speed optimization, image optimization

### üü° Content Quality Audit
- **Status**: Not done
- **Missing**: Comparison of indexed vs de-indexed pages
- **Unknown**: Why specific pages were targeted

### üü° Monitoring & Prevention
- **Status**: Scripts exist but no documented process
- **Missing**: GSC alerts, pre-publish QA, automated checks

## Expected Recovery Timeline

| Week | What to Expect |
|------|----------------|
| 1-2 | Minor improvements from meta descriptions |
| 2-4 | Consolidation of duplicate pages in GSC |
| 4-8 | If no Aug 13 investigation, flat/slow recovery |
| 8+ | Significant recovery IF E-E-A-T & quality issues addressed |
