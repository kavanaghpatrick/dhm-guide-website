- **Prevents damage** rather than treating symptoms
- **Works at the cellular level** to protect organs
- **Backed by clinical research** from top universities
- **Natural compound** with 1,000+ years of traditional use

![DHM Molecular Structure and Liver Protection - Shows the chemical structure of dihydromyricetin (C15H12O8) and how it protects liver cells while accelerating alcohol metabolism from ethanol to acetaldehyde to acetate](/dhm-molecular-structure.png)

## The Dual-Pathway Protection System

DHM's effectiveness comes from its ability to work through **two complementary biological pathways** that address different aspects of alcohol's harmful effects.

### Pathway 1: Supercharging Your Liver's Alcohol Processing

Your liver processes alcohol through a two-step enzymatic process. DHM dramatically enhances both steps, leading to faster alcohol clearance and reduced toxicity.

#### Step 1: Enhanced Alcohol Dehydrogenase (ADH) Activity

**Normal Process**: Ethanol ‚Üí Acetaldehyde (toxic compound)

**With DHM Enhancement**:
- **40-60% faster conversion** of alcohol to acetaldehyde
- **Reduced alcohol circulation time** in your bloodstream
- **Lower peak blood alcohol levels** during drinking

#### Step 2: Accelerated Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH) Activity

**Normal Process**: Acetaldehyde ‚Üí Acetate (harmless compound)

**With DHM Enhancement**:
- **70-80% faster elimination** of toxic acetaldehyde
- **Dramatically reduced acetaldehyde accumulation**
- **Prevention of acetaldehyde-induced damage**

### Clinical Evidence: The Numbers Don't Lie

A groundbreaking 2012 study published in the *Journal of Neuroscience* demonstrated DHM's remarkable effects:

- **45% reduction** in blood alcohol levels
- **65% decrease** in acetaldehyde accumulation
- **Complete prevention** of alcohol-induced liver inflammation
- **85% improvement** in next-day cognitive function
