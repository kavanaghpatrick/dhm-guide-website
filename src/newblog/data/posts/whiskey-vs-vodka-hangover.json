This comprehensive comparison will settle the debate once and for all, examining why dark liquors like whiskey consistently produce more severe hangovers than clear spirits like vodka.</p>"

Mixing clear and dark liquors combines different congener profiles and can confuse your body's processing systems, leading to worse hangovers.</p><p><strong>Q: Is expensive whiskey less likely to cause hangovers than cheap whiskey?</strong><br>A: Sometimes. Premium whiskeys may be filtered more carefully, but they still contain high congener levels. The difference is less dramatic than with vodka quality variations. This is similar to what we see with <a href=\"/never-hungover/tequila-hangover-truth\">tequila</a> - quality matters, but the base spirit characteristics remain.</p><p><strong>Q: Why do some people claim they don't get hangovers from whiskey?</strong><br>A: Individual variation exists due to genetics, liver enzyme efficiency, and drinking habits. However, scientifically, whiskey will always have higher hangover potential than vodka.</p><p><strong>Q: Does mixing vodka with juice make hangovers as bad as whiskey?</strong><br>A: No, but sugary mixers do worsen vodka hangovers. Even then, vodka with juice typically causes milder hangovers than straight whiskey.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I train my body to handle whiskey better?</strong><br>A: Regular drinking can increase enzyme efficiency, but it doesn't eliminate congeners. This \"tolerance\" comes with serious health risks and isn't recommended.</p>"
