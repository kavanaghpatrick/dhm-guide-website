However, more cost-effective options provide similar DHM content.\n\n### How does 650mg compare to other DHM supplements?\n650mg is high-potency but not the highest available. DHM1000 offers 1000mg, while standard supplements provide 300-400mg. The key is purity rather than maximum potency.\n\n### Does Mikhaila Peterson's endorsement matter?\nFor her followers and those valuing celebrity health recommendations, the endorsement adds credibility. However, effectiveness should be evaluated independently.\n\n### Can I get similar results from cheaper alternatives?\nPotentially yes. The active ingredient (DHM) is the same across brands. Fuller Health's advantage is purity and single-ingredient focus rather than unique effectiveness.\n\n### Is the GABA support claim legitimate?\nYes, DHM does interact with GABA receptors, though the binding is weak. This can contribute to improved sleep and reduced anxiety after drinking.\n\n## Final Verdict\n\nFuller Health After Party delivers on its premium positioning with high-purity DHM and celebrity endorsement backing. While expensive, the 92% satisfaction rate and focus on quality justify the premium for consumers prioritizing purity over value.\n\n**Best For:** Quality-conscious consumers, Mikhaila Peterson followers, and those seeking premium single-ingredient DHM supplements.\n\n**Skip If:** You're budget-conscious, prefer comprehensive formulations, or want maximum DHM potency regardless of purity.\n\nThe celebrity endorsement and premium positioning create a unique market position, though the core effectiveness comes from the 650mg DHM content. For consumers willing to pay premium prices for quality assurance and purity, After Party delivers.\n\n**Rating: 4.0/5** - Premium quality with celebrity backing, though price limits broader appeal.\n\nReady to try Mikhaila Peterson's DHM choice?
