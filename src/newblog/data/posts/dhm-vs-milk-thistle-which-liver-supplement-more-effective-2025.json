Enhanced Alcohol Metabolism**\n- Increases activity of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)\n- Accelerates acetaldehyde breakdown\n- Reduces toxic metabolite accumulation\n- Protects liver cells during alcohol processing\n\n**3. Antioxidant Properties**\n- Neutralizes free radicals\n- Reduces oxidative stress\n- Protects cellular membranes\n- Supports mitochondrial function\n\n**4. Anti-inflammatory Effects**\n- Inhibits inflammatory cytokines\n- Reduces liver inflammation markers\n- Protects against alcohol-induced inflammation\n- Supports immune function\n\n### DHM Research Highlights\n\nRecent studies have shown DHM's impressive effects:\n- **70% reduction** in intoxication symptoms in animal studies\n- **Significant improvement** in liver enzyme levels\n- **Enhanced recovery** from alcohol-induced liver damage\n- **Neuroprotective effects** against alcohol-related brain damage\n\n## Understanding Milk Thistle (Silymarin)\n\n### What Is Milk Thistle?\n\nMilk thistle (*Silybum marianum*) has been used for over 2,000 years as a liver remedy. Its active compound complex, silymarin, consists of several flavonolignans including silybin, silydianin, and silychristin. This time-tested supplement has extensive research backing its liver-protective properties.\n\n### Milk Thistle's Mechanisms\n\n**1. Antioxidant Protection**\n- Increases glutathione production\n- Scavenges free radicals\n- Protects liver cell membranes\n- Reduces lipid peroxidation\n\n**2.
