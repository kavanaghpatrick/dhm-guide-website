DHM supplementation ensures you're operating at peak cognitive and emotional capacity during these career-defining moments.\n\n## The High-Stakes Performance Review Reality\n\nPerformance reviews and salary negotiations are among the most consequential professional interactions you'll ever have. These conversations don't just evaluate past performance â€“ they determine future opportunities, compensation levels, and career trajectory for years to come. Yet many professionals unknowingly sabotage these critical moments through impaired cognitive performance following social activities.\n\n### The Career Impact of Performance Review Season\n\nPerformance review periods typically coincide with year-end social activities, holiday parties, and networking events that can compromise your cognitive sharpness during the most important professional conversations of the year.
