    {
      "question": "Can I take both Double Wood and Toniiq Ease together?",
      "answer": "While there's no danger in combining them, it's unnecessary and not cost-effective. The total DHM dose would be excessive for most people. Choose one based on your needs and stick with it for consistency."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which one works faster for hangover prevention?",
      "answer": "User reports suggest Toniiq Ease's pure extract absorbs 15-20 minutes faster than Double Wood. However, both should be taken 30-60 minutes before drinking for optimal effects, making the difference negligible in practice."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the price difference worth it for Toniiq Ease?",
      "answer": "It depends on your priorities. If you're sensitive to supplements, need guaranteed purity, or can't risk poor next-day performance, Toniiq's premium is justified. For regular use by healthy individuals, Double Wood provides excellent value."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to adjust dosage based on body weight?",
      "answer": "Yes, larger individuals may need higher doses. Double Wood makes this easy with 1000mg tablets - start with one and increase if needed. Toniiq users might need 2-3 capsules for the same effect, potentially reducing the cost advantage."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which has better customer service?",
      "answer": "Both companies offer responsive customer service and 30-day money-back guarantees. Toniiq provides more detailed product information and batch testing results, while Double Wood excels at quick shipping and replacement of damaged products."
