Dihydromyricetin is a natural flavonoid extracted from the Japanese raisin tree (<em>Hovenia dulcis</em>), which has been used in traditional Asian medicine for over 500 years. This long history of traditional use provides our first clue about DHM's safety profile. But you might wonder, <a href='/never-hungover/does-dhm-work-honest-science-review-2025'>does DHM actually work</a>? The effectiveness and safety often go hand in hand.</p><h3>The Traditional Safety Record</h3><p>In traditional Chinese and Korean medicine, Hovenia dulcis tea has been consumed regularly without reported adverse effects. While traditional use doesn't guarantee safety by modern standards, it does suggest that dihydromyricetin side effects are not immediately apparent or severe.</p>"
