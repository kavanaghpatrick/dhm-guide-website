Adjust for body weight: **300mg** if under 130 lbs, **600mg** if over 180 lbs. This is the clinically-proven optimal range from UCLA research.\\n\\n**Key Insight:** The timing matters as much as the dose - DHM needs 30-60 minutes to reach peak blood levels for maximum protection.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### What is the best DHM dosage for hangover prevention?\\n\\n**500mg** is the gold standard based on clinical studies. This dose provides **85% hangover symptom improvement** and **70% reduction** in liver stress. It's the sweet spot for effectiveness and safety for most people.\\n\\n### How much DHM should I take for my weight?\\n\\n**Under 130 lbs**: 300-400mg\\n**130-180 lbs**: 400-500mg (most common)\\n**180-220 lbs**: 500-600mg\\n**Over 220 lbs**: 600mg\\n\\nBody weight significantly impacts DHM metabolism and effectiveness.\\n\\n### When should I take DHM dosage?\\n\\n**30-60 minutes before drinking** for maximum effectiveness (100% benefit). You can also split-dose for long sessions (90% benefit) or take during drinking (75% benefit). Avoid taking after you're already drunk.\\n\\n### What happens if I take too much DHM?\\n\\nDHM has an excellent safety profile. Taking 800-1000mg may cause mild stomach upset but is unlikely to cause serious harm. Clinical trials tested up to 1000mg without adverse effects. Stick to recommended doses for best results.\\n\\n### Can I take DHM every day?\\n\\nDHM is designed for occasional use before drinking (2-3 times per week maximum). Daily use isn't necessary or recommended unless you drink daily (which has other health concerns). It's meant for prevention, not daily supplementation.\\n\\n### How much DHM should I take for my first time?\\n\\nStart with **300mg** to assess your individual response and tolerance. You can increase to 500mg for subsequent uses if needed. This conservative approach helps you find your minimum effective dose.\\n\\n### What is the minimum effective DHM dosage?\\n\\n**300mg** is the minimum effective dose based on Korean clinical studies from 2012. Anything below 300mg rarely provides noticeable hangover prevention benefits.\\n\\n### How long does DHM stay in your system?\\n\\nDHM has a half-life of 2-4 hours and is typically cleared from your system within 12-24 hours. This means it doesn't accumulate in your body with occasional use.\\n\\n**Info Box:** Unlike some supplements, DHM doesn't build up in your system, making it safe for occasional use without tolerance concerns.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Can I take DHM with other hangover supplements?\\n\\nYes, DHM combines safely with `NAC` (**600mg**), milk thistle (**200mg**), B-vitamins, and electrolytes. These combinations can enhance effectiveness. Avoid combining with other liver supplements without medical guidance.\\n\\n**Pro Tip:** The combination of DHM + `NAC` is particularly effective as they work through complementary liver protection pathways.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## The Bottom Line: Your DHM Dosage Action Plan\\n\\n**For optimal hangover prevention, follow this simple protocol**:\\n\\n1. **Calculate your dose**: 500mg for most adults, adjust for body weight\\n2. **Perfect your timing**: Take 30-60 minutes before drinking  \\n3. **Enhance absorption**: Take with small amount of healthy fat\\n4. **Stay consistent**: Use same dose and timing for predictable results\\n5. **Monitor response**: Adjust dose based on effectiveness\\n\\n**Remember**: DHM works best as part of a comprehensive approach including proper hydration, nutrition, and responsible drinking habits.
