    "DHM offers the most comprehensive hangover prevention by directly enhancing alcohol metabolism",
    "ZBiotics is effective but expensive - best for occasional use or those who prefer probiotics",
    "NAC and Milk Thistle excel at liver support but are less effective for acute hangover prevention",
    "Prickly Pear helps with inflammation but doesn't address the root cause of hangovers",
    "Activated Charcoal is largely ineffective for alcohol-related issues despite popular belief",

  "frequentlyAskedQuestions": [
    {
      "question": "Can I take multiple supplements together?",
      "answer": "Yes, many supplements work synergistically. DHM + NAC + Electrolytes is a popular and effective combination. Always check for interactions with medications."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which supplement has the most scientific backing?",
      "answer": "DHM and Milk Thistle have the strongest scientific evidence, with DHM having 20+ studies specific to alcohol metabolism and Milk Thistle having decades of liver health research."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the most cost-effective option?",
      "answer": "NAC offers good value at $2.14 per effectiveness point, while DHM provides the best overall effectiveness despite higher cost. Avoid Activated Charcoal for hangovers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I take supplements before or after drinking?",
      "answer": "Timing varies: DHM works best taken before, during, and after drinking. ZBiotics must be taken before. NAC and Milk Thistle can be taken daily for ongoing support."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there any safety concerns?",
      "answer": "Most supplements are safe when used as directed. NAC may interact with certain medications. Activated Charcoal can interfere with medication absorption. Always consult healthcare providers if you have concerns."
