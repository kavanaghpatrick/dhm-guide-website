          "question": "Can I cut costs by buying Fuller Health and doubling doses?",
          "answer": "You could, but you'd pay the same $0.90 per heavy drinking session while getting less DHM (1100mg vs 1200mg) and significantly less NAC (200mg vs 600mg). No Days Wasted provides better ingredients for the same price when doubled."
        },
        {
          "question": "How quickly do these products work?",
          "answer": "Both work within 30-45 minutes when taken with water. No Days Wasted's higher dose may provide slightly faster relief, but the difference is minimal according to user reports."

Neither should be seen as a license to drink irresponsibly - they reduce hangovers but don't eliminate alcohol's other health impacts."
