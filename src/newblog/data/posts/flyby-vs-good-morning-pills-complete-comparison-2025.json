          "question": "Why is Flyby so much more expensive than Good Morning Pills?",
          "answer": "Flyby costs $4.50 vs $1.00 per dose, likely due to different manufacturing costs, brand positioning, and potentially higher DHM concentrations. The 300mg DHM disclosure suggests premium dosing."
