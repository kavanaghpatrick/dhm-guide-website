## Understanding DHM (Dihydromyricetin)

### What Is DHM?

Dihydromyricetin is a flavonoid compound extracted primarily from the Japanese raisin tree (*Hovenia dulcis*). This natural substance has been used in traditional Asian medicine for centuries, but only recently has Western science begun to unlock its remarkable potential for liver protection and alcohol metabolism support.

- Accelerates acetaldehyde breakdown
- Reduces toxic metabolite accumulation
- Protects liver cells during alcohol processing

**3. Antioxidant Properties**
- Neutralizes free radicals
- Reduces oxidative stress
- Protects cellular membranes
- Supports mitochondrial function

**4. Anti-inflammatory Effects**
- Inhibits inflammatory cytokines
- Reduces liver inflammation markers
- Protects against alcohol-induced inflammation
- Supports immune function

### DHM Research Highlights

Recent studies have shown DHM's impressive effects:
- **70% reduction** in intoxication symptoms in animal studies
- **Significant improvement** in liver enzyme levels
- **Enhanced recovery** from alcohol-induced liver damage
- **Neuroprotective effects** against alcohol-related brain damage

## Understanding Milk Thistle (Silymarin)

### What Is Milk Thistle?

Milk thistle (*Silybum marianum*) has been used for over 2,000 years as a liver remedy. Its active compound complex, silymarin, consists of several flavonolignans including silybin, silydianin, and silychristin.
