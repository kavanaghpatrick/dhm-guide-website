# DHM (Dihydromyricetin) Drug Interactions and Contraindications

**Research Date:** 2025-11-09
**Purpose:** Comprehensive review of scientific evidence for potential drug interactions and contraindications for dihydromyricetin (DHM)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Key Findings:**
- Limited clinical data on drug interactions (mostly in vitro studies)
- DHM shows antiplatelet effects (theoretical bleeding risk with blood thinners)
- DHM inhibits certain CYP450 enzymes (potential for drug-drug interactions)
- Generally well-tolerated with minimal adverse events in clinical trials
- Specific populations should avoid or use with extreme caution

**Evidence Quality:** Most interaction data is theoretical/in vitro - clinical validation needed

---

## 1. DRUG INTERACTION STUDIES

### 1.1 CYP450 Liver Enzyme Interactions

**Study:** PMID 28614988 - In vitro inhibitory effects of dihydromyricetin on human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes

**Key Findings:**
- DHM **inhibits** CYP3A4, CYP2E1, and CYP2D6
  - CYP3A4: IC50 = 14.75 μM (time-dependent inhibitor, KI/Kinact = 12.17/0.057 min⁻¹ μM⁻¹)
  - CYP2E1: IC50 = 25.74 μM (competitive inhibitor, Ki = 9.24 μM)
  - CYP2D6: IC50 = 22.69 μM (competitive inhibitor, Ki = 10.52 μM)
- DHM **does NOT inhibit**: CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2C8 (at 100 μM)

**Clinical Implications:**
DHM has the potential to cause pharmacokinetic drug interactions with other co-administered drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2E1, and CYP2D6. Further clinical studies are needed to evaluate the significance of this interaction.

**Conflicting Data:**
A 2024 study (PMID 39344282) found DHM exerted no or only minor inhibitory effects on CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, suggesting possible variations in metabolites tested or methodology.

### 1.2 Transporter-Mediated Interactions

**Study:** PMID 39344282 - Interaction with organic anion-transporting polypeptides

**Key Findings:**
- Strong inhibition of **OATP1B1**: IC50 = 1.7-6.4 μM
- Very strong inhibition of **OATP2B1**: IC50 = 0.3-0.4 μM (nanomolar concentrations)

**Clinical Implications:**
Drugs transported by OATP1B1 or OATP2B1 may have altered absorption/distribution when taken with DHM.

### 1.3 Pharmacokinetic Properties

**Absorption & Metabolism:**
- Poor oral bioavailability
- Rapid metabolism (almost completely metabolized within 12 hours)
- Undergoes reduction, dehydroxylation, methylation, glucuronidation, and sulfation
- Short half-life

**Clinical Impact:** Poor bioavailability may reduce clinical significance of in vitro interactions
