## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Use specific numbers matched to personalization variables

### ❌ Burying CTAs at end
Scatter 10-15 CTAs throughout at decision points

### ❌ Paraphrasing FAQ questions
Use EXACT phrasing from GSC queries

### ❌ Long prose paragraphs
Keep paragraphs to 2-3 sentences, use emojis and bullets

### ❌ Generic product recommendations

Use emojis, short sections, frequent visual breaks
