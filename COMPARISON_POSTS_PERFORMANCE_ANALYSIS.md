## 6. Comparison Post Ranking Factors (Unique to Format)

### Why Comparisons Rank Better Than Single Reviews

**1. Keyword Optimization Advantage**

**Single Review:**
- Target keyword: "flyby recovery review"
- Competing pages: 50-100 reviews
- Differentiation: Minimal (all say similar things)

**Comparison:**
- Target keyword: "flyby vs cheers"
- Competing pages: 5-10 comparisons (lower competition)
- Differentiation: High (unique angle)

**Evidence from Data:**
- "Flyby Recovery Review" (multiple URLs): 0.13-1.53% CTR
- "Flyby vs Cheers" comparison: 4.76% CTR (3x higher)

**2. Search Intent Match Precision**

**User Journey Stage:**
```
Stage 1: Awareness - "what is DHM?"
    └─> Informational content (position 12-20)

Stage 2: Consideration - "best DHM supplement"
    └─> Comparison roundup (position 7-12)

Stage 3: Decision - "flyby vs cheers"
    └─> Head-to-head comparison (position 5-10)
    └─> HIGHEST CTR (4-11%)
```

**Why Stage 3 Wins:**
- Perfect keyword match (query = title)
- User knows exactly what they'll get
- Decision-ready = higher engagement
- Google rewards engagement with better ranking

**3. Content Comprehensiveness Signals**

**Single Review Content:**
- Word count: 1,500-2,500 words
- Topics covered: 5-8 (product features, benefits, drawbacks, price, verdict)
- Related queries answered: 3-5

**Comparison Content:**
- Word count: 3,500-4,500 words
- Topics covered: 10-12 (both products + comparison + combination + use cases)
- Related queries answered: 15-25

**Google's Perspective:**
- Comparison answers multiple related queries in one page
- Lower need for multiple result clicks (user satisfaction)
- Strong "helpful content" signal

**4. User Engagement Metrics (Presumed - Based on Rankings)**

While we don't have direct engagement data, position improvements suggest:

**Single Reviews:**
- Average time on page: 2-4 minutes (estimated)
- Bounce rate: Moderate (users scan for verdict)
- Pages per session: 1.2-1.5

**Comparison Posts:**
- Average time on page: 6-10 minutes (estimated, based on word count)
- Bounce rate: Lower (comprehensive answers reduce need to return to SERP)
- Pages per session: 2-3 (users click through to individual reviews)

**Evidence:**
- Newer comparison posts (4 months old) outrank 12+ month old reviews
- Engagement velocity must be superior to overcome age disadvantage

## 7. Monetization Advantage of Comparison Posts

### Why Comparisons Drive More Revenue

- Comparison: 2 affiliate link destinations
- Increased conversion: User can buy EITHER product (or both)

**2. Purchase Intent Timing**
- Single review readers: Often still researching (early stage)
- Comparison readers: Actively choosing between final 2-3 options (late stage)
- Conversion rate: Comparison posts likely 2-3x higher

**3. Combination Sales**
- Unique to comparison format
- Example: "DHM vs Milk Thistle" recommends using BOTH
- Outcome: 2 product sales instead of 1
- Average order value: 2x higher

**4. Updated Content Justification**
- Comparison posts justify regular updates (new products, price changes)
- "2025" in title signals freshness
- Can refresh yearly for recurring traffic surges
- Evergreen format with annual refresh cycles
