## 🔬 MECHANISM OF INTERACTIONS

### CYP450 Enzyme Inhibition
DHM **INHIBITS:**
- CYP3A4 (14.75 μM) - **Many drugs metabolized by this**
- CYP2E1 (25.74 μM)
- CYP2D6 (22.69 μM)

DHM **DOES NOT INHIBIT:**
- CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2C8

**Drugs affected by CYP3A4 inhibition:**
- Statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin)
- Immunosuppressants (tacrolimus, cyclosporine)
- Some chemotherapy drugs
- Benzodiazepines (midazolam, triazolam)
- Many others

### OATP Transporter Inhibition
- **OATP1B1:** Strong inhibition (IC50 1.7-6.4 μM)
- **OATP2B1:** Very strong inhibition (IC50 0.3-0.4 μM)

### GABA-A Receptor Modulation
- Positive modulation at benzodiazepine binding sites
- May interact with sedatives, alcohol, benzodiazepines

### Antiplatelet Effects
- Inhibits platelet activation
- Reduces fibrin generation
- May increase bleeding risk with anticoagulants

---

## 💊 DOSAGE & SAFETY

### Standard Doses:
- **Hangover prevention:** 100-600 mg (before alcohol)
- **Hangover relief:** 100-200 mg (after drinking)
- **General supplementation:** 300-1000 mg daily
- **Clinical trials:** 150-600 mg daily

### Safety Profile:
- ✅ **Minimal adverse events** in clinical trials
- ✅ **No liver toxicity** (LiverTox database)
- ✅ **Very low toxicity** in animals (>10 g/kg)
- ✅ Mild GI upset rare

### Common Side Effects (Rare):
- Nausea (mild, self-limiting)
- Diarrhea (infrequent)
- Abdominal discomfort (rare)

## 🩺 MEDICAL CONDITIONS - SAFETY SUMMARY

| Condition | Safety | Evidence | Action |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------|
| **Liver Disease** | ✅ Likely SAFE | Hepatoprotective studies | Consult if advanced cirrhosis |
| **Kidney Disease** | ✅ Likely SAFE | Renoprotective studies | Consult if on dialysis |
| **Diabetes** | ⚠️ CAUTION | Lowers blood sugar | Monitor glucose; may reduce med needs |
| **Heart Disease** | ℹ️ INFORM MD | Cardioprotective effects | Generally beneficial |
| **Autoimmune Disease** | ℹ️ INFORM MD | Anti-inflammatory | May help RA; inform rheumatologist |
| **Pregnancy** | 🚫 AVOID | No safety data | Contraindicated |
| **Breastfeeding** | 🚫 AVOID | No safety data | Contraindicated |

## 🍺 ALCOHOL INTERACTION

**✅ SAFE - This is DHM's primary studied use**

- DHM is **designed** for use with alcohol
- Reduces alcohol intoxication symptoms
- Protective against liver injury
- Reduces hangover severity
- Works via GABA-A modulation (not just metabolism)

**Note:** Recent evidence suggests DHM does NOT speed up alcohol metabolism but protects the brain and liver.

## 📋 PRE-SURGERY CHECKLIST

### 14 Days Before Surgery:
- [ ] **STOP DHM** (bleeding risk)
- [ ] Inform surgeon you've been taking DHM
- [ ] Inform anesthesiologist
- [ ] List DHM on pre-op medication form

### After Surgery:
- [ ] Wait until surgical wounds heal
- [ ] Consult surgeon before resuming
- [ ] May resume after clearance
