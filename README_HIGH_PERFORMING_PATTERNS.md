## The 4 Universal Patterns

### 1. Direct Answer First (Emoji-Driven)
Put the direct answer to the user's question in the first 100 words.
- Use emojis for visual scanning on mobile
- Include specific numbers (not vague claims)
- Match exact GSC query phrasing
- This triggers featured snippets and 8.74% CTR

**Example:** DHM Dosage Guide opens:
```
🔴 Should you take DHM BEFORE or AFTER drinking? 
Take DHM **30-60 minutes BEFORE** for 100% effectiveness.
```

**Impact:** +100-150% CTR improvement

---

### 2. Personalization/Segmentation Tables
Don't give one answer. Give 4-5 answers based on user characteristics.
- By weight/size (guides)
- By use case (comparisons)
- By budget (reviews)
- Users find themselves in the table and get specific answers

**Example:** DHM Dosage Guide:
```
| Your Weight | Light Drinking | Moderate | Heavy |
|---|---|---|---|
| <130 lbs | 300mg | 400mg | 500mg |
| 130-180 lbs | 400mg | 500mg | 600mg |
| >180 lbs | 500mg | 600mg | 600mg |
```

**Impact:** +200-300% conversions (users click affiliate links in tables)

---

### 3. Comprehensive FAQ Section (10-15 FAQs)
Match each FAQ to actual GSC queries.
- Single page ranks for 15-25 related queries instead of just 1
- Each H3 FAQ = potential featured snippet
- FAQs answer variations of the main query

**Example:** "How much DHM to take" query:
- FAQ: "DHM dosage - how much should I take?" ✓
- FAQ: "How much dihydromyricetin should I take?" ✓
- FAQ: "DHM dosage for hangover prevention?" ✓

**Impact:** Single page ranks for 13+ related queries

---

### 4. Strategic Internal Linking (8-15+ links)
Make each page a hub connector.
- Dosage guides = main hubs (receive + send 15+ links)
- Comparisons = secondary hubs (8-10 links)
- Individual reviews = spokes (2-3 links)
- Orphaned pages = 0 links = 0 clicks

**Impact:** Position improvements of 2-3 ranks + topic cluster authority
