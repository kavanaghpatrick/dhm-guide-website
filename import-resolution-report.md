# Import Resolution Diagnostic Report

## Summary
The diagnostic tests reveal that **Vite is correctly processing imports**, but there may be runtime issues with how the imports are being used in components.

## Key Findings

### ✅ File System Status
- **4/5 expected image files found** on the filesystem
- Missing: `05_traditional_heritage-1536w.webp` in `src/assets/` (exists in `public/assets/`)
- All other images exist in their expected locations

### ✅ Vite Import Processing
- **Build process successfully processes imports**
- Images are correctly moved to `dist/assets/` with content hashes
- Static imports resolve to proper URLs:
  - `liver1536w` → `/assets/02_liver_protection_infographic-1536w-upCjL0lD.webp`
  - `gaba1536w` → `/assets/04_gaba_receptor_mechanism-1536w-CFYyJnT0.webp`

### ⚠️ Potential Issues Identified

#### 1. Mixed Import Patterns
Home.jsx uses three different patterns:
```javascript
// Pattern 1: Static imports from src/assets (✅ Works)
import liver1536w from '../assets/02_liver_protection_infographic-1536w.webp'
import gaba1536w from '../assets/04_gaba_receptor_mechanism-1536w.webp'

// Pattern 2: Public path references (✅ Works)
src="/images/before-after-dhm-1536w.webp"

// Pattern 3: Public asset paths in LazyImage (❓ May have issues)
src="/assets/05_traditional_heritage-1536w.webp"
```

#### 2. ResponsiveImage Component Issues
The `ResponsiveImage` component assumes the src contains a path that can be manipulated:
```javascript
const generateSrcSet = (imagePath) => {
  const basePath = imagePath.replace(/(-\d+w)?\.webp$/, '');
  return availableSizes
    .map(w => `${basePath}-${w}w.webp ${w}w`)
    .join(', ');
};
```

**Problem**: When passed a Vite-processed import like `/assets/02_liver_protection_infographic-1536w-upCjL0lD.webp`, this function would generate invalid srcSet paths.

#### 3. LazyImage Component Path Issues
```javascript
// In Home.jsx line 547
<LazyImage
  src="/assets/05_traditional_heritage-1536w.webp"
  srcSet="/assets/05_traditional_heritage-640w.webp 640w,
          /assets/05_traditional_heritage-768w.webp 768w,
          /assets/05_traditional_heritage-1024w.webp 1024w,
          /assets/05_traditional_heritage-1536w.webp 1536w"
  // ...
/>
```

This assumes static paths that exist in the `public/` directory, which is correct for this usage.

## Root Cause Analysis

The import resolution itself is **working correctly**. The likely issues are:

1. **ResponsiveImage component incompatibility** with Vite-processed imports
2. **Incorrect path assumptions** in srcSet generation
3. **Missing file** (`05_traditional_heritage-1536w.webp` in src/assets)

## Recommended Solutions

### 1. Fix ResponsiveImage Component
The component should handle both Vite-processed imports and public paths:

```javascript
const ResponsiveImage = ({ src, availableSizes = [380, 760, 1536], ... }) => {
  const generateSrcSet = (imagePath) => {
    // If it's a Vite-processed import (contains hash), don't modify
    if (imagePath.includes('-') && imagePath.includes('.webp')) {
      const hashMatch = imagePath.match(/-([a-zA-Z0-9]+)\.webp$/);
      if (hashMatch) {
        // This is a Vite-processed asset, return as-is
        return imagePath; // Can't generate srcSet from hashed imports
      }
    }
    
    // For public paths, generate srcSet normally
    const basePath = imagePath.replace(/(-\d+w)?\.webp$/, '');
    return availableSizes
      .map(w => `${basePath}-${w}w.webp ${w}w`)
      .join(', ');
  };

  return (
    <img
      src={src}
      srcSet={generateSrcSet(src)}
      // ...
    />
  );
};
```

### 2. Consistent Import Strategy
Choose one approach for images:

**Option A: All imports via Vite** (requires pre-generating responsive versions)
```javascript
import liver380w from '../assets/02_liver_protection_infographic-380w.webp'
import liver760w from '../assets/02_liver_protection_infographic-760w.webp'
import liver1536w from '../assets/02_liver_protection_infographic-1536w.webp'
```

**Option B: All images in public/** (current approach for most images)
```javascript
// No imports needed, just use public paths
<img src="/images/image-1536w.webp" srcSet="..." />
```

### 3. Fix Missing Image
Move or copy the missing heritage image to the correct location:
```bash
cp public/assets/05_traditional_heritage-1536w.webp src/assets/
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Start dev server** and check browser console for 404 errors
2. **Test ResponsiveImage component** with both import types
3. **Verify srcSet generation** produces valid URLs
4. **Check network tab** for failed image loads
5. **Test production build** to ensure all assets are correctly processed

## Environment Details
- **Vite**: 6.3.5 ✅
- **React**: 19.1.0 ✅
- **Node.js**: 22.13.0 ✅
- **Build output**: Successfully processes imports with content hashes

The import resolution system is fundamentally working correctly. The issues are likely in the component logic that manipulates the resolved URLs.
