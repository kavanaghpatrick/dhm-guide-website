## Recommendation: 80/20 Approach

### Priority 1: Fix the 1 high-traffic post (5 minutes)
- Only **1 post** needs attention: DHM Dosage Guide
- **Impact:** 2,420 impressions/month
- **Effort:** Remove 5 characters
- **Time:** 2 minutes

### Priority 2: Template approach for Tier 3 (if time permits)
- 46 posts with <100 impressions and long metas
- Combined impact: ~200 impressions/month
- Consider batch script to auto-truncate at 160 chars with ellipsis
- Or defer until posts gain more traffic

## Traffic Distribution Analysis

**Total blog post impressions analyzed:** ~6,300
- **Top 1 post (DHM Dosage):** 2,420 impressions (38% of total)
- **Top 5 posts:** 5,812 impressions (92% of total)
- **Remaining 43 posts:** ~500 impressions (8% of total)

This confirms the power law distribution - fixing the top post delivers maximum impact with minimal effort.

## Conclusion

**Good news:** This is a much smaller problem than initially expected.

Instead of needing custom meta descriptions for 48 posts, you only need to fix **1 post** by removing 5 characters. The other 4 high-traffic posts are already optimized.

The 46 low-traffic posts with long metas have negligible search visibility and can be addressed with a template approach or deferred entirely.

**Recommended Action:** Fix the DHM Dosage Guide meta description (2 minutes) and call it done.
