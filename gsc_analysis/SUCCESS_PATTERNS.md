   - 14.67% CTR = 4x higher than product pages (4.57%)
   - Avg position 7.4 = good but not great ranking

3. **Product comparisons are saturated:** 20 pages, 41 clicks = 2.05 clicks/page
   - Solid CTR (4.57%) but diluted across too many pages
   - Many rank on page 1 (8.5 avg position) but don't stand out

## 8. Actionable Patterns Summary

### What Works (Double Down):

1. **Dosage content = 60% of traffic**
   - Create: "DHM Dosage for Women", "DHM Dosage by Body Weight", "Optimal DHM Timing & Dosage"

2. **Comparisons have 6.62% CTR** (2x guides)

## Conclusion

The data reveals a **dosage-dominant traffic pattern** with clear optimization opportunities. The site excels at answering "how much" queries (34% CTR) but underutilizes comparison content (6.62% CTR but stuck at position 8-10). Moving 14 comparison pages from position 8-10 to the sweet spot of 4-7 could **double site traffic** with minimal content changes—just better internal linking and title optimization.

The biggest missed opportunity is the Research hub: 882 impressions with 0% CTR despite ranking position 7.4. Fixing the title alone could add **40+ clicks per month**. Similarly, reoptimizing the "hangover duration" page from position 83 to position 15 could tap into massive search volume.

**Bottom line:** This site has strong foundational content (guides, comparisons) but needs better on-page optimization (titles, metas) and internal linking to push pages from position 8-10 into the high-converting position 4-7 range.
